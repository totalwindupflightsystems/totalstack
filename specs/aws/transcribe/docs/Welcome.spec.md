This guide provides detailed information on the Amazon Transcribe API, including operations, request and response syntax, data types, and error codes. For more information about Amazon Transcribe, refer to the [Amazon Transcribe Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/what-is.html).

The Amazon Transcribe API reference is separated into the following sections:
+ [Actions](API_Operations.md)
+ [Data Types](API_Types.md)
+ [Common Error Types](CommonErrors.md)
+ [Common Parameters](CommonParameters.md)

If you're transcribing a media file located in an Amazon S3 bucket, you're performing a *batch transcription* and must use the operations and data types listed in the **Amazon Transcribe Service** section.

If you're transcribing a real-time media stream, you're performing a *streaming transcription* and must use the operations and data types listed in the **Amazon Transcribe Streaming Service** section.
