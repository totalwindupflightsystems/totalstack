# What is Amazon OpenSearch Service?
<a name="what-is"></a>

Amazon OpenSearch Service is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale OpenSearch clusters in the AWS Cloud. An OpenSearch Service domain is synonymous with an OpenSearch cluster. Domains are clusters with the settings, instance types, instance counts, and storage resources that you specify. Amazon OpenSearch Service supports OpenSearch and legacy Elasticsearch OSS (up to 7.10, the final open source version of the software). When you create a domain, you have the option of which search engine to use.

***OpenSearch*** is a fully open-source search and analytics engine for use cases such as log analytics, real-time application monitoring, and clickstream analysis. For more information, see the [OpenSearch documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/).

***Amazon OpenSearch Service*** provisions all the resources for your OpenSearch cluster and launches it. It also automatically detects and replaces failed OpenSearch Service nodes, reducing the overhead associated with self-managed infrastructures. You can scale your cluster with a single API call or a few clicks in the console.

![Data sources flow into OpenSearch Service , which outputs to monitoring, SIEM, and search uses.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/images/whatis.png)


To get started using OpenSearch Service, you create an OpenSearch Service *domain*, which is equivalent to an OpenSearch *cluster*. Each EC2 instance in the cluster acts as one OpenSearch Service node.

You can use the OpenSearch Service console to set up and configure a domain in minutes. If you prefer programmatic access, you can use the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/), the [AWS SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/code), or [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/opensearch_domain).

We recommend upgrading to the latest available OpenSearch version to get the best use of OpenSearch Service, in terms of price-performance, feature richness, and security improvements.

## Standard and extended support
<a name="end-of-support"></a>

AWS provides bug fixes and security updates for versions under standard support. For versions in extended support, AWS offers critical security fixes for at least 12 months after standard support ends, at a flat fee per Normalized Instance Hour (NIH). NIH is based on instance size and usage hours.

Extended support charges apply automatically when a domain runs a version that is no longer under standard support. To avoid these charges, upgrade to a supported version. 

The following tables show the end of support schedule for OpenSearch and legacy Elasticsearch versions.

OpenSearch Service supports multiple versions of OpenSearch and legacy open-source Elasticsearch versions. For some versions, we have already published end of standard support and extended support dates. We recommend that you upgrade to the latest available OpenSearch version to get the best use of OpenSearch Service in terms of price-performance, feature richness, and security improvements. The following tables provide lists of Elasticsearch and OpenSearch versions and their support schedules.

The end of support schedule for Elasticsearch versions is as follows:


| Software Version | End of Standard Support | End of Extended Support | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Elasticsearch versions 1.5 and 2.3 | November 7, 2025 | November 7, 2026 | 
| Elasticsearch versions 5.1 to 5.5 | November 7, 2025 | November 7, 2026 | 
| Elasticsearch versions 5.6 | November 7, 2025 | November 7, 2028 |

## Standard support and extended support of OpenSearch and Elasticsearch
<a name="standard-support-extended-suppport"></a>

AWS provides regular bug fixes and security updates for versions covered under Standard Support. For versions under Extended Support, AWS provides critical security fixes for a period of at least 12 months after end of standard support, for an additional flat fee each Normalized Instance Hour (NIH). NIH is computed as a factor of the instance size (e.g. medium, large), and number of instance hours (see calculating extended support charges section below for an example). Extended support charges are applied automatically when a domain is running a version for which standard support has ended. You can upgrade to a recent version that is still covered under standard support to avoid extended support charges. For more information on extended support charges, see the [pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/pricing/#Extended_support_costs). For general information about extended support, see the [Extended Support FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/faqs/#awt-content-topics#ams#c111#extended-support-9).

## Calculating extended support charges
<a name="calculating-charges"></a>

Domains running versions under extended support will be charged a flat additional fee/Normalized Instance Hour (NIH), for example, $0.0065 in the US East (North Virginia) Region. NIH is computed as a factor of the instance size (e.g., medium, large), and the number of instance hours. For example, if you are running an m7g.medium.search instance for 24 hours in the US East (North Virginia) Region, which is priced at $0.068/Instance hour (on-demand), you will typically pay $1.632 ($0.068x24). If you are running a version that is in extended support, you will pay an additional $0.0065/NIH, which is computed as $0.0065 x 24 (number of instance hours) x 2 (size normalization factor; 2 for medium-sized instances), which comes to $0.312 for extended support for 24 hours. The total amount you will pay for 24 hours will be a sum of the standard instance usage cost and the extended support cost, which is $1.944 ($1.632\+$0.312). The below table shows the normalization factor for various instance sizes in OpenSearch Service.


| Instance size | Normalization Factor | 
| --- | --- | 
| nano | 0.25 | 
| micro | 0.5 | 
| small | 1 | 
| medium | 2 | 
| large | 4 | 
| xlarge | 8 | 
| 2xlarge | 16 | 
| 4xlarge | 32 | 
| 8xlarge | 64 | 
| 9xlarge | 72 | 
| 10xlarge | 80 | 
| 12xlarge | 96 | 
| 16xlarge | 128 | 
| 18xlarge | 144 | 
| 24xlarge | 192 | 
| 32xlarge | 256 | 

## Pricing for Amazon OpenSearch Service
<a name="pricing"></a>

For OpenSearch Service, you pay for each hour of use of an EC2 instance and for the cumulative size of any EBS storage volumes attached to your instances. [Standard AWS data transfer charges](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/) also apply.

However, some notable data transfer exceptions exist. If a domain uses [multiple Availability Zones](managedomains-multiaz.md), OpenSearch Service does not bill for traffic between the Availability Zones. Significant data transfer occurs within a domain during shard allocation and rebalancing. OpenSearch Service neither meters nor bills for this traffic. Similarly, OpenSearch Service does not bill for data transfer between [UltraWarm](ultrawarm.md)/[cold](cold-storage.md) nodes and Amazon S3.

For full pricing details, see [Amazon OpenSearch Service pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/pricing/). For information about charges incurred during configuration changes, see [Charges for configuration changes](managedomains-configuration-changes.md#managedomains-config-charges).
