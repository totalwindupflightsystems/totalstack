# What is Amazon Lightsail?
<a name="what-is-amazon-lightsail"></a>

Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for anyone who needs to build websites or web applications. It includes everything you need to launch your project quickly—instances (virtual private servers), container services, managed databases, content delivery network (CDN) distributions, load balancers, SSD-based block storage, static IP addresses, DNS management of registered domains, and resource snapshots (backups)—for a low, predictable monthly price.

Lightsail also offers Amazon Lightsail for Research. With Lightsail for Research, academics and researchers can create powerful virtual computers in the AWS Cloud. These virtual computers come with pre-installed research applications, such as RStudio and Scilab. For more information see the [Amazon Lightsail for Research User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lightsail-for-research/latest/ug/what-is-lfr.html).

## Features of Lightsail
<a name="lightsail-features"></a>

Lightsail provides the following high-level features:

**Instances**  
Lightsail offers virtual private servers (instances) that are easy to set up and backed by the power and reliability of AWS. You can launch your website, web application, or project in minutes, and manage your instance from the intuitive Lightsail console or API.  
As you’re creating your instance, you will click-to-launch a simple operating system (OS), a pre-configured application, or development stack—such as WordPress, Windows, Plesk, LAMP, Nginx, and more. Every Lightsail instance comes with a built-in firewall that you can use to allow or restrict traffic to your instances based on source IP, port, and protocol. [Learn more](understanding-instances-virtual-private-servers-in-amazon-lightsail.md)

**Containers**  
Run and securely access containerized applications in the cloud. A container is a standard unit of software that packages code and its dependencies together so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. [Learn more](amazon-lightsail-container-services.md)

**Load balancers**  
Route web traffic across your instances so your websites and applications can accommodate variations in traffic, protected against outages, and deliver a seamless visitor experience. [Learn more](understanding-lightsail-load-balancers.md)

**Managed databases**  
Lightsail offers a fully configured MySQL or PostgreSQL databases plan that includes memory, processing, storage, and transfer allowance. With Lightsail managed databases, you can easily scale your databases independently of your virtual servers, improve application availability, or run standalone databases in the cloud. [Learn more](amazon-lightsail-databases.md)

**Block and object storage**  
Lightsail offers both block and object storage. You can scale your storage quickly and easily with highly available SSD-backed storage for your Linux or Windows virtual server. [Learn more](elastic-block-storage-and-ssd-disks-in-amazon-lightsail.md)  
With Lightsail Object storage buckets, you can store and retrieve objects, at any time, from anywhere on the internet. You can also host static content on the cloud. [Learn more](buckets-in-amazon-lightsail.md)

**CDN distributions**  
Lightsail enables content delivery network (CDN) distributions, which are built on the same infrastructure as Amazon CloudFront. You can easily distribute your content to a global audience by setting up proxy servers across the world, so that your users can access your website geographically closer to them, thus reducing latency. [Learn more](amazon-lightsail-content-delivery-network-distributions.md)

**Access to AWS services**  
Lightsail uses a focused set of features like instances, managed databases and load balancers to make it easier to get started. But that doesn't mean you're limited to those options –you can integrate your Lightsail project with some of the 90\+ other services in AWS through Amazon VPC peering.

## Who is Lightsail for?
<a name="who-is-lightsail-for"></a>

Lightsail is for everyone. You can choose an image for your Lightsail instance that jump starts your project so you don't have to spend as much time installing software or frameworks.

If you're an individual developer or hobbyist working on a personal project, Lightsail can help you deploy and manage basic cloud resources. You might also be interested in learning or experimenting with cloud services, such as virtual machines, domains or networking. Lightsail provides a quick way to get started.

Lightsail has images with base operating systems, development stacks like LAMP, LEMP (Nginx), and SQL Server Express, and applications like WordPress, Drupal, and Magento. For more detailed information about the software installed on each image, see [Choose a Lightsail instance image](compare-options-choose-lightsail-instance-image.md).

As your project grows, you can add block storage disks and attach them to your Lightsail instance. You can take snapshots of these instances and disks and easily create new instances from those snapshots. You can also peer your VPC so that your Lightsail instances can use other AWS resources outside of Lightsail.

You can also create a Lightsail load balancer and attach target instances to create a highly available application. You can also configure your load balancer to handle encrypted (HTTPS) traffic, session persistence, health checking, and more.

## Get started with Lightsail
<a name="how-to-get-started-lightsail"></a>

After you set up to use Lightsail, you can walk through [Getting started with virtual private servers on Lightsail](getting-started.md) to launch, connect to, and clean up an instance. For more information on how to access Lightsail, see [Access Lightsail](access-lightsail.md) .

## Related services

You can provision Lightsail resources, such as instances and disks, directly using Lightsail. In addition, you can provision resources using other AWS services, such as the following:
+ [Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com//ec2)

  Provides resizeable computing capacity—literally, servers in Amazon's data centers—that you use to build and host your software systems. To compare Lightsail and Amazon EC2, see [Amazon Lightsail or Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/decision-guides/latest/lightsail-or-ec2/lightsail-or-ec2.html).
+ [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling)

  Helps ensure you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application.
+ [Elastic Load Balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing)

  Automatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple instances.
+ [Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rds)

  Set up, operate, and scale a managed relational database in the cloud.
+ [Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecs)
